<h3>Features</h3>
    <p> The fur of the Pallas's Cat is very dense, almost a plush texture, and their ears are small, rounded, and set low on the sides of their heads. They are the size of the average domestic cat, 46-65cm (18-26 inches) with a long tail that often has seven black rings and a black tip. Their body is stocky and because their fur is so dense, they give the appearance of being a chonk.</p>

  <h2> What I Learned</h2>
     <p>I acquired several valuable lessons today during the course of learning basic html code. 
     <ol><li>Learning both html and Markdown is a frustrating experience. I wish I had learned one and then the other. As an Elder Millennial, I am experienced with the basics of both, but learning them as separate languages one and then the other has been very annoying. Practice will make this less annoying, but still</li>.
     <li>html is very particular and detailed oriented. This is good because it forces you to <em>sloooooooow down</em> and literally make sure that all the i's are dotted and t's crossed. Or at least the brackets and / are all there</li>
     <li>As a writer, I feel compelled to hand type everything. This does not work in html because if you miss <strong>ANYTHING</strong> you will be pulling your hair out trying to find the error. ctrl C and ctrl V are my friends!</li>
